A State of Systems is my personal blog. It is meant to write down and share my thoughts on systems design, systems engineering and systems thinking.
I'm also looking to share some of my other interests here, for example nature photography.

The name of the blog is obviously inspired by the radioshow of Armin van Buuren, A State of Trance, which often accompanies me when I am working or travelling :)

Cheers!
Steven Haveman
